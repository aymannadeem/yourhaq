## Other information
- **Do not sign the I-407:** For anyone coming into the country, signing [this form](https://www.uscis.gov/i-407) strips you of your residency. There may be pressure at the border to sign this, especially for people who are non-residents.

## Overview of Trump's Executive Order
Under President Trump's executive order, foreigners from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya or Somalia are not allowed to enter the United States of America. This rule applies to all “aliens”—a term that encompasses anyone who isn’t an American citizen, meaning it could bar those with current visas or even green cards from returning to the U.S. from trips abroad.

### Community project goals and values

While this V1 doesn't accomplish all goals, YourHaq aims to develop into a service capable of the following:

1. **Connect people to legal aid.** Presently, it's hard to know which lawyers, firms or orgs can offer representation to individuals with varying statuses (ex., refugees, green card holders, permanent residents, undocumented and work visa immigrants). It's also difficult to know who can do it pro-Bono (for those who might be financially restricted).

2. **Build a record of discriminatory data.** Despite social media, many discriminatory incidents have gone unnoticed and undocumented for the last 16+ years. Given how aliens and green card holders are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, there is no hard evidence pointing at a systemic flaw and miscarriage of justice. Curating incidents may help create transparency into the immigration process, as well as helping to identify aggregate trends that the international human rights community could respond to. Reporting experiences with the right nuance (where you were, what was said to you, which flight were you boarding, who were you with, what forms did they make you fill out, where were you traveling to and from, etc) may help contribute to a more regimented and objective understanding and practice of immigration law.

## About YourHaq
"Haq" is an Arabic word whose meaning is found at the intersection of the words "right", "truth" and "just". YourHaq translates to "your right", dedicated to supporting the true American vision of human rights.
